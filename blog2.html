                                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                        <h5>1.1- Understanding the mind</h5>
                                        I think that without understanding how our own mind works, we cannot understand
                                        or solve the complex problems of life. This understanding does not come from
                                        book knowledge. The mind itself is a complex problem. The difficult situations
                                        and challenges that we all have to face in our lives, in the process of
                                        understanding the mind, their secret also gets revealed and it becomes possible
                                        to go beyond them.
                                        <br>
                                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                                        I think it is vitally important to understand the workings of our mind
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <h5>2.1- What is mind?</h5>
                                        We do not know the workings of our own mind, the mind as it is, not as it ought
                                        to be, or as we wish to make it. We have the mind as the system by which we
                                        think, act and in which we have the feeling of being ourselves. We all have this
                                        active mind and until we understand this active mind, every problem we face will
                                        become more complex and more destructive. That is why I feel that understanding
                                        one's own mind is the first and most important lesson in any education.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        What is our mind? Your mind and mine? Not according to someone else's statement.
                                        Perhaps it will be more appropriate and beneficial to enter into the whole
                                        context of thought when you observe the activity of your own mind while
                                        listening to me, not following the description of the mind given by me. What is
                                        our Desire mind? Climate, tradition of centuries, so-called culture, social and
                                        economic influence, environment, thoughts, obstinate religious principles
                                        imposed by the society in the name of religion, so-called knowledge and 'Riligi'
                                        divine message-is not the result of all this cast of mind? ? Please observe your
                                        own mindDo not follow the details mentioned by as the details are of negligible
                                        importance.If we can consciously observe the activity of our mind, then
                                        perhapsWe were able to solve the problems of life immediately.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        This mind is divided into two parts, conscious and unconscious. If we do not
                                        want to use these two words, we can use other terminologies for them-superficial
                                        and covert-the superficial parts of the mind and its deeper layers. Conscious
                                        and unconscious as a whole, from the surface to the bottom, in its entirely the
                                        process of thought, that is, the only part of our mind of which we are
                                        conscious, and the remaining part, which is the greater part of our mind and of
                                        which we are not conscious, together we call it consciousness. . This is
                                        consciousness time, it is the result of what man has been doing for centuries.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Believing in certain ideas is hardwired into us from childhood. We are molded to
                                        fit rigid dogmas, beliefs and practices. Each one of us is molded according to
                                        different kinds of influences, and it is from these influences, so molded,
                                        limited and unconsciously imbibed, that our thoughts arise which form a
                                        Communist, a Hindu, a Muslim or a Scientist. Let's take It is clear that ideas
                                        are born out of a background of memory and tradition and it is with this
                                        background that we face life. Be it the background of the conscious mind or the
                                        unconscious mind, its surface or its deeper layers, life is always It is
                                        dynamic, it never remains static but our mind is static, motionless. It is
                                        realistic, imprisoned and freed from the shackles of dogmatic dogmas, beliefs,
                                        experiences and knowledge. With this pegged, moulded, shackled mind we face a
                                        life that is in constant motion. Life never stands still with its many complex
                                        and changing problems in the blink of an eye. Therefore, there is a need to see
                                        it from a new perspective everyday and every moment. So, when we are faced with
                                        this life, there is a constant conflict going on between this ever-moving life
                                        and our past-bound and immobile mind. That's what's happening, isn't it?
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        There is not only a conflict between life and the moldy mind, butSuch a mind
                                        becomes the cause of more and more problems while facing life. We keep getting
                                        superficial information, we keep learning new knowledge and methods to conquer
                                        nature and science, but despite getting knowledge and science, the mind is stuck
                                        in a certain mold, bound by a particular belief.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        So, our problem is not how to face life, but our mind which is molded by rigid
                                        dogmas and beliefs.
                                        has happened, how can he free himself. Only a mind that is free can be
                                        successful in facing life, not a mind that is bound by the mold of any dogma,
                                        any belief or any particular knowledge. So, if we are not to increase our
                                        problems, if we are to put an end to our misery and our misery, does it not
                                        become important for us to understand the workings of our own mind?
                                        <h5>2.2- Knowing the self</h5>
                                        Do we know what we mean by this ego, the self? In my understanding, it includes
                                        thoughts, memories, conclusions, experiences, conscious and unconscious motives,
                                        conscious efforts to become something or not to become something, the
                                        accumulated memory of one's unconscious mind, caste, class, personal or lineage,
                                        and the messiness of it all. All this may be done externally in the form of
                                        action or spiritually in the form of virtues, but behind all this there is only
                                        the ego which runs longingly. The desire to become something else is also
                                        included in this competition. The whole process of all this is the ego. When it
                                        comes to us then we know exactly that it is a bad thing. I use the word 'bad'
                                        deliberately because this ego is divisive, self-centred, dividing and divisive,
                                        no matter how noble its activity may seem. We all know this. We also know those
                                        extraordinary moments when this ego is no more, when there is no sense of
                                        striving or struggling, and this happens in a state of love.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        2.3- Self-realization is a continuous process, So in order to understand the
                                        myriad problems we all face, isn't it imperative
                                        that we know ourselves, have self-awareness? and it's the Hardest One of the
                                        things is self-awareness – which does not mean separation nor detachment. It is
                                        clear that it is necessary to know oneself but it does not mean to separate
                                        oneself from relationships. And it is certainly a mistake to think that by
                                        isolation, by abstinence, or by going to a psychiatrist or a priest or by
                                        reading a book, one can know oneself thoroughly and completely. Undoubtedly
                                        self-realization, knowing oneself is a continuous process, it is not an end goal
                                        and for this it is necessary that a person should be aware of himself when he is
                                        in action, that is, when he is dealing in relationships. You cannot know your
