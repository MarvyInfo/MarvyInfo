                                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                        <h5>1.1 Fear</h5>
                                        We live in fear, not only externally but also internally. External fears like
                                        loss of livelihood, not getting enough to eat, loss of position, ill-treatment
                                        by higher officials remain. We also have a lot of fear internally - fear of not
                                        being able to last, fear of not being successful, fear of death, fear of
                                        loneliness, fear of not being able to find love, fear of utter boredom etc.
                                        <br>
                                        <h4>2. Overview </h4>
                                        So our primary problem, our real and inevitable problem, is to be free from
                                        fear. Do you know what fear does? It darkens the mind, makes it blunt. Fear
                                        breeds violence. Someone is worshiped only because of fear.
                                        <h4>3: physical fear - animalistic response</h4>
                                        So first comes physical fear which is an animal response. Since we have
                                        inherited a lot from animals, therefore a large part of our brain-structure is
                                        the gift of animals. This is a scientific fact. This is not an opinion, but a
                                        fact. The animal is greedy, it likes to be petted, patted, to live in peace-the
                                        same way humans like it. The animal likes to grab, compete – so does the human
                                        being. Animals like to live in groups – similarly humans like to work in groups.
                                        Animals have their own social structure – so do humans. We could go into more
                                        detail, but this much is enough to see that much of us is still animal.

                                        <h4>4: Can we break free from both animal and cultural influences?</h4>
                                        So is it possible for us not only to break free from animal influence but to go
                                        further and find out - not just in the form of verbal curiosity but really find
                                        out whether the mind is influenced by that society, by that culture. He can go
                                        beyond the influence of the culture in which he is brought up. It is necessary
                                        to be fearless for the possibility of a situation of a completely different
                                        dimension.
                                        <br>
                                        <h4>5: Physical fear protecting the body is rational, our problem is mental fear
                                        </h4>
                                        It is clear that the reaction done for self-defense is not fear. Food, clothing
                                        and shelter – these are the needs of all of us, not only the rich, not only the
                                        elite. This is everyone's need and politicians do not have the solution.
                                        Politicians have divided the world into countries, such as India. These
                                        countries have their own separate sovereign government, their own separate army
                                        and all the toxic idiocy like nationalism. The political problem is only one and
                                        that is to bring about human unity. And that cannot be brought about as long as
                                        you cling to your national or ethnic divisions. Sir, when the house is burning
                                        you don't ask who is bringing the water, you don't ask the hair color of the
                                        person who set the house on fire, you just bring water. Just as religions have
                                        divided men, in the same way nationalism has divided men. This nationalism and
                                        these religious beliefs have alienated man from man, turned each other against
                                        each other and one can see why this is happening. This is happening because we
                                        like to have limited knowledge
                                        <br>
                                        So one has to be fearless, but it is one of the most difficult tasks. Most of
                                        the time we are not even aware that we are afraid, nor do we know what we are
                                        afraid of. Even if we become aware that we are afraid, we do not know what to do
                                        then. That's why we start running away from what we are, whereas we are the
                                        fear, and wherever we go by running away, the fear only increases. And
                                        unfortunately we have spread a web of migrations.
                                        <h4>
                                            6: attention kills fear</h4>
                                        When you have such total and total attention, then there is no observer left. It
                                        is the observer who is the source of fear, because it is the observer who is the
                                        center of thought—the 'mine', the 'I', the self, the ego. This observer is
                                        flawed. When there is no thought then it is not even an observer. This state is
                                        not a state of emptiness. This requires a lot of due diligence – that is, one
                                        should never just take things for granted.
                                        <h4>
                                            7: The root of all fear
                                        </h4>
                                        Dependence on things, persons and ideas gives rise to fear. Dependence arises
                                        from ignorance, lack of self-realization and inner misery. Bhava becomes a
                                        factor of uncertainty in the mind and brain and this uncertainty becomes a
                                        hindrance in communication and understanding. Through self-awareness, we begin
                                        to discover and understand the cause of fear—not just superficial fear, but also
                                        deep-rooted and cumulative fears. Fear is innate as well as comes from the
                                        outside. It is associated with the past, so it is necessary to understand the
                                        past in order to free thought-feeling from it, and that too through the present,
                                        the past is always eager to give birth to the present which is 'me', 'my' and
                                        'I'. The memory becomes the counterpart of '. This is the root of all fear.
